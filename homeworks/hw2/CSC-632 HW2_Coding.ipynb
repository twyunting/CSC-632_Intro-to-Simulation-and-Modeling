NOTE: Instead of 1⁄4 of the circle (depicted in Figure 4.2), use half (1/2) of the circle and redo the exercise accordingly.\n","\n","a. Repeat the Python code using N = 100, 1000, 10000. Explain about the initial value and the role of Large Numbers in the calculation of Pi number. Explain all the codes, all functions, and different methodology in Python.\n","\n","b. Re-do the plot of the Pi estimation in Figure 4.3 for the half circle. Provide three figures for different cases where N = 100, 1000, 10000. Explain all the codes. Explain how the increasing number of N changes the figures."]}]}
