Some of the questions require exploring in different sources and conversation among team members. After collecting all the answers and explanations, you need to collect a unified summary and provide a report about your observations about the companies and organizations using operations management techniques and strategies. Only one copy by the group representative is required due to submission. Please submit one WORD copy for answering the questions and one .py file containing all Python codes. No page limit or format is imposed. Try your best to submit a professional and comprehensive report.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IYZTSIGWUH7O"},"source":["# **Problem 1: Weather Forecast:**\n","\n","\n","Answer the following questions:\\\n","a) Calculate the proportion of days that it rains.\\\n","b) If it rains today, what is the probability that a it also rains tomorrow?\\\n","c) If it rains on Monday, what is the probability that it is sunny on Wednesday?\\\n","d) If it rains on Monday, what is the chance it also rains on three consecutive days (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday)?\n","\n","Discussion Questions:\\\n","e) If you are a weather forecast manager, do you think the Markov Chains method alone is enough in predicting the weather?
