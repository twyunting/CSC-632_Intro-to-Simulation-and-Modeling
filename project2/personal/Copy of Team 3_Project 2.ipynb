The plane can hold 100 people. It costs \\$8000 to fly an empty plane. The airline incurs variable costs of \\$30 (food and fuel) for each person on the plane. If the flight is overbooked, anyone who cannot get a seat receives \\$300 in compensation. Not everyone who has a reservation shows up for the flight. The number of people with reservations who actually show up for the flight is binomial with p = 0.95.
