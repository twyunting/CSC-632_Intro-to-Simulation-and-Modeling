    "Six months before its annual convention, The Computer Science Conference (CSC) must determine how many rooms to reserve. CSC believes the number of people attending the convention will be normally distributed with a mean of 5000 and a standard deviation of 1000.(Clearly, this demand must be rounded to an integer since only whole people attend the conference.) At this time, CSC can reserve rooms at a cost of $50 per room. CSC can reserve up to 8000 rooms, but it must reserve rooms in blocks of 100. CSC must pay the $50 room cost even if the room is not occupied. If the number of people attending the convention exceeds the number of rooms reserved, extra rooms must be reserved at a cost of $80 per room. (Do the following steps by hand or using MS Excel, and run the simulation using Python and include the .py file in the submission folder.)\n",
